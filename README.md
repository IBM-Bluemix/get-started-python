# Getting Started with Python on IBM Cloud

To get started, we'll take you through a sample Python Flask app, help you set up a development environment, deploy to IBM Cloud and add a Cloudant database.

<p align="center">

The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">
</p>

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:
* [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/)
* [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## 1. Clone the sample app

Now you're ready to start working with the app. Clone the repo and change to the directory where the sample app is located.
  ```
git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/get-started-python
cd get-started-python
  ```

  Peruse the files in the *get-started-python* directory to familiarize yourself with the contents.

## 2. Run the app locally

Install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) file to be able to run the app locally.

You can optionally use a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/installing/#creating-and-using-virtual-environments) to avoid having these dependencies clash with those of other Python projects or your operating system.
  ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Run the app.
  ```
python hello.py
  ```

 View your app at: http://localhost:8000

## 3. Prepare the app for deployment

To deploy to IBM Cloud, it can be helpful to set up a manifest.yml file. One is provided for you with the sample. Take a moment to look at it.

The manifest.yml includes basic information about your app, such as the name, how much memory to allocate for each instance and the route. In this manifest.yml **random-route: true** generates a random route for your app to prevent your route from colliding with others.  You can replace **random-route: true** with **host: myChosenHostName**, supplying a host name of your choice. [Learn more...](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#appmanifest)
 ```
 applications:
 - name: GetStartedPython
   random-route: true
   memory: 128M
 ```

## 4. Deploy the app

You can use the Cloud Foundry CLI to deploy apps.

Choose your API endpoint
   ```
cf api <API-endpoint>
   ```

Replace the *API-endpoint* in the command with an API endpoint from the following list.

|URL                             |Region          |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------|
| https://api.ng.bluemix.net     | US South       |
| https://api.eu-de.bluemix.net  | Germany        |
| https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net  | United Kingdom |
| https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net | Sydney         |

Login to your IBM Cloud account

  ```
cf login
  ```

From within the *get-started-python* directory push your app to IBM Cloud
  ```
cf push
  ```

This can take a minute. If there is an error in the deployment process you can use the command `cf logs <Your-App-Name> --recent` to troubleshoot.

When deployment completes you should see a message indicating that your app is running.  View your app at the URL listed in the output of the push command.  You can also issue the
  ```
cf apps
  ```
  command to view your apps status and see the URL.

## 5. Add a database

Next, we'll add a NoSQL database to this application and set up the application so that it can run locally and on IBM Cloud.

1. Log in to IBM Cloud in your Browser. Browse to the `Dashboard`. Select your application by clicking on its name in the `Name` column.
2. Click on `Connections` then `Connect new`.
2. In the `Data & Analytics` section, select `Cloudant NoSQL DB` and `Create` the service.
3. Select `Restage` when prompted. IBM Cloud will restart your application and provide the database credentials to your application using the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. This environment variable is only available to the application when it is running on IBM Cloud.

Environment variables enable you to separate deployment settings from your source code. For example, instead of hardcoding a database password, you can store this in an environment variable which you reference in your source code. [Learn more...](/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#app_env)

## 6. Use the database

We're now going to update your local code to point to this database. We'll create a json file that will store the credentials for the services the application will use. This file will get used ONLY when the application is running locally. When running in IBM Cloud, the credentials will be read from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.

1. Create a file called `vcap-local.json` in the `get-started-python` directory with the following content:
  ```
  {
    "services": {
      "cloudantNoSQLDB": [
        {
          "credentials": {
            "username":"CLOUDANT_DATABASE_USERNAME",
            "password":"CLOUDANT_DATABASE_PASSWORD",
            "host":"CLOUDANT_DATABASE_HOST"
          },
          "label": "cloudantNoSQLDB"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

2. Back in the IBM Cloud UI, select your App -> Connections -> Cloudant -> View Credentials

3. Copy and paste the `username`, `password`, and `host` from the credentials to the same fields of the `vcap-local.json` file replacing **CLOUDANT_DATABASE_USERNAME**, **CLOUDANT_DATABASE_PASSWORD**, and **CLOUDANT_DATABASE_URL**.

4. Run your application locally.
  ```
python hello.py
  ```

  View your app at: http://localhost:8000. Any names you enter into the app will now get added to the database.

5. Make any changes you want and re-deploy to IBM Cloud!
  ```
cf push
  ```

  View your app at the URL listed in the output of the push command, for example, *myUrl.mybluemix.net*.

## Connecting a MongoDB Database

You'll need access to a MongoDB instance. The below steps outline how to do this:

1. Sign in to your IBM Cloud Console, and select the 'Create Resource' button in the top right of the page.
2. Type 'MongoDB' in the search field and select 'Compose for MongoDB' under the 'Data & Analytics' section.
3. Check that the name/region/organization/pricing fields are accurate.
4. Select the 'Create' button in the botton left of the page.
5. Return to the IBM Cloud dashboard and select the newly created service.
6. In the sidebar on the left side of the page, select 'Service Credentials'
7. Select the 'New Credential' button, and then the 'Add' button in the page that appears.

You will also need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again to install the required [MongoDB driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver).

To prepare the application for use in a local environment, use the below steps. Otherwise, skip the steps to move on to deploying the application to IBM Cloud:

1. Make a copy of the 'vcap-local.template.json' file (in the application root directory) as 'vcap-local.json' in the same directory.
2. Copy the contents of the 'uri' field in the credentials generated from earlier into the field (replacing "MONGO_DATABASE_URI").
3. Run the application using `python hello.py`.

Before deploying the application, make sure that it builds successfully by running `python hello.py` from the root directory of the project (where this README document is located). If no errors are shown, run `cf push` to deploy the application. Once the deployment process completes, run `cf bind-service GetStartedPython [SERVICE_NAME]`, where [SERVICE_NAME] is the name of your MongoDB service. Finally, run `cf retage GetStartedPytohon`. Once this finishes, you can access the application using the URL provided in the output from the 'cf push' command from earlier.

## Additional Notes on Changes

The application may work with either Cloudant or MongoDB. However, if both services are available (and at most one is user-provided), **the application will default to MongoDB**. If both services are available as user-provided services, this behavior is **not** guaranteed, and the application may default to either service.

When deployed on IBM Cloud, this application **does** require bound MongoDB services to have some permutation of 'mongodb' in the name. User-provided services (as created with the cf utility) are also acceptable.
